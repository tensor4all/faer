> This is a tensor4all fork of [faer](https://codeberg.org/sarah-quinones/faer)
> (the GitHub `sarah-ek/faer-rs` repository is a mirror). The `t4a-faer*` crates
> published from here are experiment builds for `tenferro-rs`, `tlinalg-rs` and
> `tprims-rs`.
>
> ### Stance
>
> - **An AI-driven, high-speed experiment bench.** Coding agents iterate here at
>   full speed. Commits, tests and reviews are optimized for fast iteration, not
>   for matching upstream's review standards.
> - **A place for destructive experiments.** Features shaped for the tensor4all /
>   tenferro workload — strided and batched entry points, typed uninitialized
>   overwrite destinations, caller-owned workspaces, an explicit thread policy —
>   get tried and broken without ceremony. API churn and removal are expected,
>   and compatibility is not promised.
> - **The experiments are recorded.** What was tried, kept, or dropped is
>   tracked in
>   [`PATCHSET.md`](https://github.com/tensor4all/faer/blob/main/PATCHSET.md).
>
> The crate body stays `MIT`, keeping the upstream copyright and attribution.
> Code ported from other projects keeps its own `COPYING` terms (see
> [`NOTICE`](https://github.com/tensor4all/faer/blob/main/NOTICE)). Use this fork
> only through a pinned git revision or the published `t4a-faer*` versions.

`faer` is a rust crate that implements low level linear algebra routines and a high level wrapper for ease of use, in pure rust.
the aim is to provide a fully featured library for linear algebra with focus on portability, correctness, and performance.

see the [official website](https://faer.veganb.tw) and the [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/faer/latest/faer) documentation for code examples and usage instructions.

questions about using the library, contributing, and future directions can be discussed in the [zulip server](https://faer.zulipchat.com).
